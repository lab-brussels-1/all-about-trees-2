<!-- some introduction -->

We want to help users who know what a tree is but not much more than that, they
can come hear to begin learning more about trees. This site isn't designed for
tree experts.

## Government worker

- Fiona is 45 years old local government worker with a Masters in Public
  Management who works as a Grants Manager. She decides which projects get the
  limited funding of the govt. Her role involves researching into each of the
  projects through books, articles, videos, blogs, websites and organizations to
  decide which of the projects can bring the most social benefit in the
  long-run.
- She wants to have the basic understanding of each project so she can make the
  right decisions. But she also doesn't want to spend too much time on research
  for one project so as not to be biased in her decision and due to time
  constraints.
- She is frustrated when she has to search in many places with many different
  sources for the information she's looking for. She'd like to have it all in
  one place along with a summary that's easy to understand for a normal person
  without prior background on the topic
- She received a project proposal from a company that grows and researches trees
  and requires funding of $1M among the many other project proposals she
  received. As she only has a budget of $1M to allocate, she has to choose
  between these projects and has to justify her decision with her own research
  into the topics of each of the proposals to judge whether the funding
  requested is a reasonable amount and the research is actually viable.
