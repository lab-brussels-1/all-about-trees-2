        How do Trees Work?
        <br />
        All trees are an evolutionary success story and have shaped the planet
        into the hospitable home we know and love today.
        <br />
        All trees gather light for photosynthesis through their leaves; this
        process creates “food” for the tree.Most of a tree trunk is dead tissue
        and serves only to support the weight of the tree crown.The outside
        layers of the tree trunk are the only living portion.The cambium
        produces new wood and new bark.

        <p>
          In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or
          trunk, usually supporting branches and leaves. In some usages, the
          definition of a tree may be narrower, including only wood plants with
          secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a
          specified height. In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns,
          bananas, and bamboos are also trees. Trees are not a taxonomic group
          but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved
          a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete
          for sunlight.
