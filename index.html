          In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or
          trunk, usually supporting branches and leaves. In some usages, the
          definition of a tree may be narrower, including only wood plants with
          secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a
          specified height. In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns,
          bananas, and bamboos are also trees. Trees are not a taxonomic group
          but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved
          a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete
          for sunlight.
