        How do Trees Work?
        <br />
        All trees are an evolutionary success story and have shaped the planet
        into the hospitable home we know and love today.
        <br />
        All trees gather light for photosynthesis through their leaves; this
        process creates “food” for the tree.Most of a tree trunk is dead tissue
        and serves only to support the weight of the tree crown.The outside
        layers of the tree trunk are the only living portion.The cambium
        produces new wood and new bark.
